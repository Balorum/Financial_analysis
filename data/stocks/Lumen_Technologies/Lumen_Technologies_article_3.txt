The tech sector is under pressure as Wall Street seeks real returns and results from its AI investments. Lumen Technologies (LUMN) CEO Kate Johnson joins Market Domination to discuss the AI hype and the technology's trajectory."Every single new piece of technology goes through a J-curve. Just because the big companies are well-capitalized and have a ton of cash doesn't mean that they have to produce return on the first dollar spent... And these companies, what they're seeing is this need for a different level of infrastructure, higher bandwidth, thicker pipes, faster pipes. And they're committing the capital to build out this critical infrastructure for decades to come," Johnnson explains.She notes that these companies are working on 10 and 20-year plans, and investors won't see immediate returns.With the continued growth of AI demand, Jonshon says that Lumen is going through a huge transition: "We're upskilling, reskilling. We're redeploying people away from lower-value work towards higher-value work. And, of course, we're switching out the composition of our skill sets on a fairly regular basis."For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Market Domination.This post was written by Melanie Riehl
