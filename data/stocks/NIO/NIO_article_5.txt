NIO Inc. (NIO) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned -16.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -0.4% change. The Zacks Automotive - Foreign industry, to which NIO belongs, has lost 11.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, NIO is expected to post a loss of $0.46 per share, indicating a change of +9.8% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1.41 points to a change of +19.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of -$1 indicates a change of +29.6% from what NIO is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for NIO.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:While earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of NIO, the consensus sales estimate of $2.35 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +94.5%. The $9.24 billion and $15.26 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.6% and +65.2%, respectively.NIO reported revenues of $1.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -11.7%. EPS of -$0.36 for the same period compares with -$0.42 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.42%. The EPS surprise was -16.13%.Over the last four quarters, NIO surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.NIO is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers.
