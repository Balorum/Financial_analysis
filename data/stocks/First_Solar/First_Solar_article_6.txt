On Wednesday, Susquehanna maintained a Positive rating on First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) and increased the shares target to $285 from $258. The adjustment comes ahead of the company's second quarter earnings report. Susquehanna anticipates First Solar will continue to benefit from strong average selling prices (ASPs) due to recent policy changes, including the removal of the bifacial exemption and the start of a new anti-dumping/countervailing duty (AD/CVD) investigation. These developments are expected to support higher pricing for First Solar’s domestic-content-eligible panels.The firm also notes that the current political environment and the growth in electricity demand could pave the way for First Solar to expand its manufacturing capabilities. This potential expansion is contingent on the continuation of incentives provided by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) after the upcoming election.
