TYSONS CORNER, Va. - MicroStrategy Incorporated (NASDAQ:MSTR), known for its enterprise analytics and mobility software, has unveiled a new feature within its MicroStrategy ONE platform that allows enterprises to integrate AI-powered insights directly into any application without coding. This enhancement aims to facilitate quick and data-driven decision-making for frontline workers.The latest update to MicroStrategy ONE includes the HyperIntelligence feature, now powered by MicroStrategy's generative AI solution, Auto. This feature enables employees to access on-demand, relevant data insights within their current applications, streamlining their workflow.
