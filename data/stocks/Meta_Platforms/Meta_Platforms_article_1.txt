The smart glasses have Meta AI built in, with the ability to give information on the item a user is looking at.WHY IT'S IMPORTANTThe first version of smartglasses, born from the collaboration between Meta and Essilorluxottica, were reported to have struggled to catch on with consumers.KEY QUOTESEssilorLuxottica's CEO Francesco Milleri said that the first generation of smart glasses, called Ray-Ban Stories, paved the way for the success of the new generation of smart glasses."Today people's expectations are clearer.. hence the success of the second generation," Milleri said on the sidelines of an event in Milan. The AI feature on the Meta's Ray-Ban is restricted to the US and not allowed in Europe at the moment."In Europe we are waiting for the decision of the new Artificial Intelligence Act, which we hope will arrive soon", Milleri added.
