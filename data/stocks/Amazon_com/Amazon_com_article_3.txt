(NYSE American: NBY) gears up for its promotional event during Amazon Prime Day, investors may be weighing the potential impact on the company's financials. According to recent data from InvestingPro, the company's revenue has been growing, with an 11.49% increase in the last twelve months as of Q1 2024, and a quarterly revenue growth of 12.48% in Q1 2024. This suggests that NovaBay's sales initiatives, such as the upcoming Prime Day discount, could continue to drive revenue growth.However, NovaBay's financial health is not without its concerns.

These figures indicate that despite increasing revenues, profitability remains a challenge for the company. Additionally, the gross profit margin is relatively strong at 53.86%, which could imply that while NovaBay is effective at managing the cost of goods sold, other expenses are impacting the bottom line.Investors should note that NovaBay's stock price has experienced significant volatility.
