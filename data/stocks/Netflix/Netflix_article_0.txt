On Tuesday, Benchmark raised the price target for Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares to $545 from the previous $450, while still maintaining a Sell rating on the stock. The firm's analyst cited an increase in the assumed normalized price-to-earnings ratio for the Nasdaq 100, which went from 25 times to 27 times next twelve months earnings. This adjustment extends the valuation into the year 2025.The new price target reflects a modest $30 increase based on a more aggressive market assumption. Benchmark's forecasts, which extend through 2033, predict Netflix will reach 424 million members and achieve a 36.1% operating margin. These figures are notably higher than consensus estimates available for later years.Netflix's management has been recognized for its successful strategies, particularly in areas such as paid sharing, its advertising-supported video on demand (AVOD) efforts, and the introduction of substantial new content. Noteworthy future content includes NFL Christmas Day games and WWE Raw slated for the following year.Despite these positive developments, the analyst noted the potential challenges Netflix faces. Content execution can be inconsistent, and there have been early signs of advertiser dissatisfaction with the AVOD platform, specifically regarding scale, targeting, and measurement. Additionally, there's pressure on AVOD pricing in the upfront market, which is partly due to competition from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime.Benchmark's assessment reflects a complex view of Netflix's business trajectory, acknowledging strong operational performance while also pointing out areas of concern that contribute to the continued Sell rating.In other recent news, Netflix has been the subject of several positive adjustments from Wall Street firms.
