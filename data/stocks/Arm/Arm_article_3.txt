On Monday, BofA Securities updated its outlook on  Arm  Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) shares, raising the price target to $180 from the previous $150, while reaffirming its Buy rating on the stock. The firm's analysis suggests that Arm Holdings is poised for growth due to two main factors: the accelerated adoption of its v9 architecture and market share gains over competitors such as Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).The firm anticipates that the transition to Arm's v9 architecture, which could potentially double or increase royalty rates by 4-5%, alongside a complete compute solution that might quadruple or boost rates by 8-10%, will be significant growth drivers. Additionally, the adoption of Arm technology by more licensees, which is expected to deliver power-efficient processors for client and data center applications, is seen as a catalyst for market share gains against established rivals that rely on x86 architecture.The new price objective of $180 is based on unchanged earnings estimates but applies a higher price-to-earnings (PE) multiple of 95 times the calendar year 2025 earnings, compared to the prior 79 times. Despite the increase, the price-to-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio remains within the firm's target range of 2 to 3 times. This valuation also falls within the range of growth comparisons, where trading multiples range from 19 to 134 times the calendar year 2025 PE.In conjunction with its optimistic stance on Arm Holdings, BofA Securities has also revised its forecasts for Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU), increasing the fiscal year 2024 and 2025 earnings estimates by 28% and 21% to $0.85 and $8.70, respectively. The price objective for Micron has been adjusted to $170 from $144, reflecting a higher price-to-book (P/B) multiple of 3.1 times for the calendar year 2025, up from the previous 2.8 times.The firm expects Micron to benefit significantly from the growing market for high-bandwidth memory in cloud computing and the annual 12-15% increase in DRAM requirements to support advancements in AI, PCs, and smartphones. This positive outlook on Micron is aligned with the broader expectations for growth in the technology sector, particularly in areas that leverage advanced memory and processing capabilities.In other recent news, Arm Holdings has been added to the Nasdaq-100 Index, reflecting its growing influence in the technology sector.
