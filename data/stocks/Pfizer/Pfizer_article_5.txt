    Pfizer     Inc. (NYSE:PFE, “Pfizer”) and BioNTech SE (NASDAQ:BNTX) (Nasdaq: BNTX, “BioNTech”) today announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has recommended marketing authorization for the companies’ Omicron JN.1-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine (COMIRNATY® JN.1) for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 6 months of age and older. The adaptation is based on the recommendation from the World Health Organization (WHO) Technical Advisory Group on COVID-19 Vaccine Composition and the European Medicines Agency's Emergency Task Force (ETF) to update COVID-19 vaccines to target the SARS-CoV-2 variant JN.1 for the 2024-2025 vaccination campaign. ETF stated that “evidence indicates that targeting JN.1 will help maintain the effectiveness of the vaccines as SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve.”1,2 The European Commission (EC) will review the CHMP’s recommendation and is expected to make a final decision soon. Following the EC decision, the updated vaccine will be available to ship to applicable EU member states immediately. Pfizer and BioNTech have been manufacturing the Omicron JN.1-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine at risk to ensure supply readiness ahead of the upcoming fall and winter season when the demand for COVID-19 vaccination is expected to increase.2The CHMP’s recommendation is based on the full body of previous clinical, non-clinical, and real-world evidence supporting the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines by Pfizer and BioNTech. The application also included manufacturing and pre-clinical data showing that the JN.1-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine generates a substantially improved response against multiple Omicron JN.1 sublineages, including KP.2, KP.3 and other currently circulating sublineages, compared with the companies’ Omicron XBB.1.5-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccine.3Pfizer and BioNTech are starting rolling applications with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), per recent FDA recommendation, requesting approval of their Omicron KP.2-adapted monovalent COVID-19 vaccines for individuals 6 months of age and older. The companies will continue to monitor the evolving epidemiology of COVID-19 and make appropriate preparations to meet global public health needs.The COVID-19 vaccines (COMIRNATY®) by Pfizer and BioNTech are based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and were developed by both companies.
