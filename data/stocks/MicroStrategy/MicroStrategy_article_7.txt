MicroStrategy® Incorporated (Nasdaq: MSTR), a pioneer in AI-powered business intelligence, today announced that, in an industry first, the latest release of the MicroStrategy ONE platform enables enterprises to layer contextual, bite-sized AI insights into any application within a no-code environment. This capability builds on HyperIntelligence®, a long-time feature within MicroStrategy ONE that pioneered contextual BI. This powerful capability in MicroStrategy ONE empowers frontline workers to rapidly access relevant, on-demand data insights within any application and ask questions about that data using natural language to go even deeper. As a result, MicroStrategy ONE can enable data-driven decision-making throughout the entire enterprise.Enterprises are struggling to make data accessible and actionable for frontline workers when they need it, so they can make accurate, data-driven decisions quickly. Employees often need to navigate multiple systems to find the information they need, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. Unsurprisingly, only 24% of managers and 22% of executives mostly base their decisions on data.MicroStrategy ONE’s HyperIntelligence feature, which is now powered by Auto (MicroStrategy’s generative AI solution), pairs AI and BI capabilities to empower every frontline worker, whether they work in a browser or on a mobile device. This no-code solution doesn’t require system integration, so it can automatically be overlayed onto any application so users can easily access trusted, relevant information from within their daily workflow.For example, an enterprise could set up a Hyper card within MicroStrategy ONE to provide key product descriptions when a user hovers over the product’s name within any app on the screen, and frontline employees can ask for additional information using natural language. They simply type a question for information on sales, customer satisfaction, and any other desired datapoints and Auto will provide an instant response from trusted BI data in MicroStrategy ONE. Sales representatives, medical personnel, and call center agents can now access critical information quickly while assisting customers, enabling data-driven decision making throughout the entire organization.“Our ambition, within data and analytics, is to deliver seamless access to relevant information to our business users; and that's what the MicroStrategy ONE AI-powered HyperIntelligence capability does. The platform integrates actionable information into the daily routines of our deal and investment teams, without requiring them to access back-end transactional systems," said Aidan Millar, Senior Director of Data & Advanced Analytics at Mubadala Investment Company, a $276 billion sovereign investor that spans six continents. “The new feature of The GenAI chat capability in Hyper cards, with MicroStrategy AI, will enable our users to also ask questions of their data – this will be game changing!”“HyperIntelligence has long been one of the most innovative capabilities of MicroStrategy’s BI platform, providing all employees with key information via bite-sized AI insights when they need it, where they need it,” said Saurabh Abhyankar, EVP and chief product officer at MicroStrategy. “With Auto now incorporated into HyperIntelligence, employees can easily dig deeper to obtain additional information. The data-driven business is no longer just a dream. At MicroStrategy, we’re making it a reality.”For more information on HyperIntelligence, now enhanced with generative AI, visit https://www.microstrategy.com/hyperintelligence.
