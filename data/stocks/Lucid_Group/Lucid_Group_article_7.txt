On Monday, CFRA maintained its Strong Sell rating on Lucid Group Inc. (NASDAQ:LCID) with a steadfast $1.00 price target, despite the electric vehicle manufacturer's recent deliveries report showcasing a record number of shipments. The firm's updated analysis follows Lucid's announcement of its second-quarter vehicle production and deliveries, which totaled 2,110 and 2,394 units respectively—slightly surpassing CFRA's projections.Lucid Group's latest quarterly figures represent a new high for the company, outperforming its first-quarter deliveries of 1,967 units. However, CFRA points out that these numbers fall short of the scale necessary for Lucid to reduce its unit costs effectively. The current cost of goods sold (COGS) for the Lucid Air remains high, at $206,000 per vehicle as of the first quarter.The financial health of the company is also under scrutiny, with a reported cash and equivalents balance of $4.0 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2024, against a total debt of $2.4 billion. Lucid's cash burn rate is averaging around $700 million per quarter, which raises concerns about its long-term sustainability.Furthermore, the market's response to Lucid's product offerings has been tepid. Significant price reductions have not translated into a substantial increase in consumer interest for the Lucid Air, indicating potential challenges in the company's path to profitability.Looking ahead, Lucid Group is scheduled to report its earnings on August 5. Meanwhile, CFRA has adjusted its forecast for Lucid's 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS), raising it slightly to -$1.33 from -$1.35, while maintaining the 2025 EPS estimate at -$1.25. Despite the incremental increase in its EPS estimate for 2024, CFRA's outlook on Lucid Group remains unchanged.As Lucid Group Inc.
