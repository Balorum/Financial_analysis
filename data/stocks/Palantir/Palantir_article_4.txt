Bank of America strategists have unveiled a new list of 10 short-term stock recommendations among US stocks under their coverage, based on anticipated significant market and business-related catalysts in the upcoming quarter.For Q3 2024, BofA’s top 10 ideas include nine Buy-rated and one Underperform-rated names, spanning nine different industries.The stocks rated as Buys are AutoNation (NYSE:AN),  Elanco Animal Health  (NYSE:ELAN),  General Electric  (NYSE:GE),  Global Payments  (NYSE:GPN), Goldman Sachs (GS), Palantir (NYSE:PLTR), Spotify (NYSE:SPOT),  Union Pacific  (NYSE:UNP), and Vertiv (VRT). The one stock rated as Underperform is CarMax (NYSE:KMX).Strategists also commented on the broader equity market's direction, noting that whether it will lean towards a correction or sustain its upside remains a topic of debate.Still, the bank said its recent technical strategy report indicates that when the S&P 500 Index (SPX) rallies in the first six months of the year, it often continues to perform strongly for the rest of the year, especially after a first-half rally of between 10% and 20%.“According to our strategists, bullish 2H scenarios support SPX 5700-6000,” BofA strategists said.
