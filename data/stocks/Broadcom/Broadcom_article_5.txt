On Tuesday, Evercore ISI adjusted the price target for Broadcom Limited (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares following a recent 10-to-1 stock split. The new target has been set at $201, down from the pre-split target of $2,010, while the firm maintains an Outperform rating on the stock.The revision comes after Broadcom announced the stock split on June 12, 2024, which took effect after the market closed on July 12, 2024. Trading on a split-adjusted basis began on Monday. The adjustment in the price target reflects the stock division, setting the new target at a point that corresponds to the post-split share structure.Evercore ISI has based the new price target on a forward-looking earnings per share (EPS) estimate. The $201 target assumes a 27.5 times multiple on the firm's projected 2027 EPS base case of $9, discounting back two years at a rate of 10%. This price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is above the historical range of 10 to 20 times that Broadcom has traded at over the past 15 years.The rationale behind the elevated P/E multiple, according to Evercore ISI, lies in the company's strategic positioning. Broadcom's role as a provider of artificial intelligence processors and networking chips is seen as providing visibility into the company's future performance, justifying the higher multiple compared to historical averages.In other recent news, Broadcom has been the subject of several significant developments.
