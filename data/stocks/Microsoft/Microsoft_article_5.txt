On Tuesday, Mizuho Securities updated its outlook on Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), increasing the price target to $480 from the previous $450, while maintaining an Outperform rating on the stock. The adjustment follows Microsoft's fiscal third-quarter earnings, where the tech giant reported total revenue of $61.9 billion, surpassing the $60.8 billion forecast by analysts.The revision was influenced by Microsoft's Azure cloud service's performance, which saw a 31% year-over-year constant currency (CC) revenue growth, outperforming the expected ~28%. Notably, Azure's core consumption CC growth was reported at 24% year-over-year, consistent with the previous quarter and approximately three percentage points higher than anticipated. This growth was attributed to an uptick in cloud migration activities.Additionally, artificial intelligence (AI) advancements have played a significant role in Azure's revenue increase, contributing around seven percentage points to its growth, compared to a roughly six-point contribution in the previous quarter. Despite the ongoing challenges in the global market, Mizuho highlighted that Microsoft's medium-term revenue growth prospects appear to be more significant than many may realize.The firm's confidence in Microsoft is also bolstered by the company's tangible adoption and monetization of generative AI (GenAI) technology. Mizuho's updated price target of $480 is primarily derived from its Sum of the Parts (SoTP) model, and reflects a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 40 times for calendar year 2024 estimates and 34 times for calendar year 2025 estimates.In other recent news, Microsoft Corporation is in the spotlight with several key developments.
