On Tuesday, Barclays expressed a favorable stance on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) shares, highlighting the streaming giant's potential to surpass subscriber expectations for the second quarter.Despite the company's decision to cease the disclosure of subscriber data starting next year, which will render this key performance indicator (KPI) less useful for projecting growth, Netflix's revenue growth rate is anticipated to be in the mid-teens percentage this year and at least in the low teens for the next year.Netflix's stock has already responded to the anticipated strong subscriber growth. However, the correlation between subscriber growth and revenue growth has been weak, as evidenced last year when a record increase in subscribers did not translate to proportionate revenue growth.Furthermore, the introduction of advertising is expected to dilute pricing leverage, and the potential normalization of subscriber growth following the paid sharing initiative could pose challenges to achieving the projected revenue targets.The possibility of Netflix eliminating the basic tier in the U.S. and other markets, pushing users towards higher-priced or ad-supported plans, mirrors experiments currently conducted in the UK and Canada. This strategy change, however, may not be seamless, as seen by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s recent experience with a similar move resulting in immediate engagement drops.Barclays also notes that Netflix is in the nascent stages of its sports content investments, which are set to significantly increase globally in the coming years. This, along with the development of in-house advertising technology, may lead to a decelerated pace of margin expansion next year.Despite these challenges, Netflix's exceptional execution makes it difficult to take a negative position on the company. Yet, as Netflix's business model begins to resemble that of a typical media company, Barclays suggests some risk mitigation in the stock ahead of the earnings report.In other recent news, Netflix has seen a flurry of activity from analysts. Benchmark raised the price target for Netflix to $545 while maintaining a Sell rating, citing an increase in the assumed normalized price-to-earnings ratio.In contrast, BofA Securities, Argus, and Loop Capital have raised their price targets for Netflix to $740, $767, and $750 respectively, citing strong subscriber growth trends and potential revenue boosts from strategic initiatives such as live sports programming and an advertising-supported video on demand (AVOD) service.Meanwhile, Citi and Piper Sandler maintained neutral stances on Netflix with price targets of $660 and $600 respectively, closely observing potential subscriber growth and revenue trends. Additionally, another Wall Street firm raised Netflix's price target to $775, up from $725, based on anticipated subscriber growth and revenue from the AVOD service.Netflix's expansion into live sports programming, notably its NFL deal, and the addition of an ad-supported subscription tier have been highlighted as strategic moves. Furthermore, a tentative three-year agreement between the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which includes significant pay increases and terms regulating AI use in the industry, impacts Netflix among other industry players. These are among the recent developments for Netflix.As Netflix approaches its second-quarter earnings report, investors are closely monitoring its performance metrics.
