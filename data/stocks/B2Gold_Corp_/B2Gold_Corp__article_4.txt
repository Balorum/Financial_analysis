VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Aug. 08, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- B2Gold Corp. (TSX: BTO, NYSE AMERICAN: BTG, NSX: B2G) (“B2Gold” or the “Company”) announces its operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2024. All dollar figures are in United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.2024 Second Quarter HighlightsTotal gold production of 212,508 ounces: Total gold production in the second quarter of 2024 was 212,508 ounces, including 8,267 ounces of attributable production from Calibre Mining Corp. (“Calibre”). Production at the Fekola Mine in the second quarter of 2024 was below expectations as a result of damage to an excavator and the delay in receiving replacement equipment which impacted equipment availability for the second quarter of 2024, reducing tonnes mined. These equipment availability issues are being addressed and mining rates are expected to improve by the end of the third quarter of 2024.Total consolidated cash operating costs of $839 per gold ounce produced, at the low end of the annual guidance range: Total consolidated cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) of $839 per gold ounce produced during the second quarter of 2024 with consolidated cash operating costs from the Company’s three operating mines of $808 per gold ounce produced.Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs of $1,267 per gold ounce sold, below the annual guidance range: Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) (including estimated attributable results for Calibre) of $1,267 per gold ounce sold for the second quarter of 2024 with consolidated all-in sustaining costs from the Company’s three operating mines of $1,244 per gold ounce sold.Total gold production for 2024 now expected to be between 800,000 and 870,000 ounces (including 20,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre): Total gold production for 2024 is expected to be impacted by the delay in mining higher-grade ore from Phase 7 of the Fekola pit due to equipment availability issues, resulting in an expected decrease of approximately 50,000 ounces in Fekola production for full year 2024. Mining and processing of these ounces is now expected in the first half of 2025. Lower anticipated Fekola production is partially offset by increased gold production guidance at Masbate and Otjikoto, by 10,000 ounces combined. In addition, following the sale of a portion of the Company's equity interest in Calibre in June 2024, the Company will stop reporting its share of attributable Calibre production going forward. In 2024, B2Gold now expects total gold production to be between 800,000 and 870,000 ounces (including 20,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre). The previous 2024 total gold production range of between 860,000 and 940,000 ounces included 40,000 to 50,000 ounces of attributable production from Calibre.Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (including attributable results for Calibre) for 2024 now expected to be between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce: Total consolidated all-in sustaining costs (including attributable results for Calibre) for 2024 are now forecast to be between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce (original guidance range of between $1,360 and $1,420 per ounce).Attributable net loss of $0.02 per share; adjusted attributable net income of $0.06 per share: Net loss attributable to the shareholders of the Company in the second quarter of 2024 of $24 million ($0.02 per share), primarily the result of a non-cash impairment of the Fekola Complex; adjusted net income (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) attributable to the shareholders of the Company of $78 million ($0.06 per share).Operating cash flow before working capital adjustments of $192 million: Cash flow provided by operating activities before working capital adjustments was $192 million in the second quarter of 2024.Strong financial position and liquidity: At June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $467 million and working capital (defined as current assets less assets classified as held for sale and current liabilities) of $600 million.Q3 2024 dividend of $0.04 per share declared: On August 8, 2024, B2Gold's Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024 of $0.04 per common share (or an expected $0.16 per share on an annualized basis), payable on September 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of September 10, 2024.All planned construction for the first half of 2024 necessary to produce gold at the Goose Project by the end of Q2 2025 now complete and project development remains on schedule: B2Gold successfully completed the 2024 Winter Ice Road (“WIR”) campaign in the second quarter of 2024 and has delivered all necessary items from the Marine Laydown Area (“MLA”) to complete the construction of the Goose Project in the second quarter of 2025. The key construction items completed in the second quarter included the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the MLA to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, which are anticipated to begin to receive fuel in August 2024; the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the Goose Project site to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, of which two of the three tanks have been completed with the third tank expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024; and the purchase of materials necessary to complete construction and the staging of those materials for shipment to the MLA during the 2024 sealift.Positive Preliminary Economic Assessment (“PEA”) results for the Gramalote Project; feasibility work has commenced: On June 18, 2024, the Company released the results of a positive PEA on its 100% owned Gramalote Project located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. Highlights of the PEA include a significant production profile with average annual gold production of 185,000 ounces over a 12.5 year project life and strong project economics with an after-tax net present value discounted at 5% (“NPV5%”) of $778 million and an after-tax internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 20.6%. B2Gold has commenced feasibility work with the goal of completing a feasibility study by mid-2025.Initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate announced for the Springbok Zone of the Antelope deposit at the Otjikoto Mine: On June 20, 2024, the Company released an initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate for the Springbok Zone, the southernmost shoot of the recently discovered Antelope deposit, located approximately three kilometers (“km”) south of the Otjikoto Phase 5 open pit at the Otjikoto Mine in Namibia. The Company determined that the initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate was sufficient to initiate a PEA on development of the deposit by underground mining methods, similar to the Wolfshag deposit. Subject to the receipt of a positive PEA and permit, mining of the Springbok Zone, coupled with the exploration potential of the greater Antelope deposit, could begin to contribute to gold production at Otjikoto in 2026.Partnered with Sandbox Royalties Corp. (“Sandbox”) to create Versamet Royalties Corporation (“Versamet”); B2Gold expected to receive $90 million equity interest in Versamet: On June 5, 2024, B2Gold entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell a portfolio of 10 precious and base metals royalties to Sandbox, a private returns-focused metals royalty company, for consideration of 153.2 million common shares at a price of C$0.80 per share, representing an equity ownership interest in Versamet of 33.0% valued at approximately $90 million.Second Quarter 2024 Results  Three months endedSix months ended June 30,June 30, 2024 202320242023     Gold revenue ($ in thousands)492,569 470,854954,013944,410Net (loss) income ($ in thousands)(34,777) 91,85013,704193,754(Loss) earnings per share – basic(1) ($/ share)(0.02) 0.060.010.14(Loss) earnings per share – diluted(1) ($/ share)(0.02) 0.060.010.14Cash provided by operating activities ($ thousands)62,432 194,983773,159398,806Average realized gold price ($/ ounce)2,343 1,9692,2021,934Adjusted net income(1)(2) ($ in thousands)78,449 85,804159,952191,666Adjusted earnings per share(1)(2) – basic ($)0.06 0.070.120.16Consolidated operations results:    Gold sold (ounces)210,228 239,100433,206488,250Gold produced (ounces)204,241 245,961418,580496,680Production costs ($ in thousands)151,299 152,762308,044280,366Cash operating costs(2) ($/ gold ounce sold)720 639711574Cash operating costs(2) ($/ gold ounce produced)808 607762591Total cash costs(2) ($/ gold ounce sold)877 777857714All-in sustaining costs(2) ($/ gold ounce sold)1,244 1,2101,2961,128Operations results including equity investment in Calibre:    Gold sold (ounces)218,495 255,897452,850521,189Gold produced (ounces)212,508 262,701438,224529,557Production costs ($ in thousands)164,520 170,577333,170313,946Cash operating costs(2) ($/ gold ounce sold)753 667736602Cash operating costs(2) ($/ gold ounce produced)839 636785618Total cash costs(2) ($/ gold ounce sold)908 800879738All-in sustaining costs(2) ($/ gold ounce sold)1,267 1,2141,3081,135(1) Attributable to the shareholders of the Company.(2) Non-IFRS measure.

At June 30, 2024, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $467 million (December 31, 2023 - $307 million) and working capital (defined as current assets less assets classified as held for sale and current liabilities) of $600 million (December 31, 2023 - $397 million). At June 30, 2024, the full amount of the Company's $700 million revolving credit facility was undrawn and available.Third Quarter 2024 DividendOn August 8, 2024, B2Gold’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) declared a cash dividend for the third quarter of 2024 (the “Q3 2024 Dividend”) of $0.04 per common share (or an expected $0.16 per share on an annualized basis), payable on September 23, 2024, to shareholders of record as of September 10, 2024.In 2023, the Company implemented a Dividend Reinvestment Plan (“DRIP”). For the purposes of the Q3 2024 Dividend, the Company is pleased to announce that a discount of 3% will be applied to calculate the Average Market Price (as defined in the DRIP) of its common shares issued from treasury. However, the Company may, from time to time, in its discretion, change or eliminate any applicable discount, which would be publicly announced, all in accordance with the terms and conditions of the DRIP. Participation in the DRIP is optional.

For a description of how these measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable measures specified, defined or determined under IFRS and presented in the Company’s financial statements, refer to “Non-IFRS Measures”.The Fekola Mine in Mali (owned 80% by the Company and 20% by the State of Mali) produced 111,583 ounces of gold in the second quarter of 2024, slightly below expectations due to the delayed timing of mining of high-grade ore as compared to expectations, resulting in less high-grade ore processed during the second quarter of 2024. For the second quarter of 2024, mill feed grade was 1.51 grams per tonne (“g/t”), mill throughput was 2.52 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 92.8%. Damage to an excavator and the subsequent need for replacement equipment impacted equipment availability for the second quarter of 2024, reducing tonnes mined. These equipment availability issues are being addressed through the delivery of a new excavator, and mining rates are expected to improve by the end of the third quarter of 2024. The reduction in mining rate capacity experienced in 2024 is anticipated to impact the availability of higher-grade ore from Phase 7 of the Fekola pit during the second half of 2024 resulting in an expected decrease of approximately 50,000 ounces in Fekola production for full year 2024. Mining and processing of these ounces is now expected in the first half of 2025. Ore volumes and grades continue to reconcile well with modeled values.The Fekola Mine’s cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $839 per gold ounce produced ($707 per gold ounce sold). Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the second quarter of 2024 were lower than expected as a result of lower fuel costs, higher mill throughput, higher gold recovery and lower mining costs as a result of lower than anticipated mined tonnage due to equipment availability.All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,258 per gold ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs were lower than expected as a result of lower than anticipated production costs per gold ounce sold and lower than expected sustaining capital expenditures partially offset by higher gold royalties resulting from a higher than anticipated average realized gold price. The lower sustaining capital expenditures were mainly due to timing of expenditures and are expected to be incurred later in 2024.Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 totalled $53 million primarily consisting of $13 million for deferred stripping, $9 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, $9 million for the construction of a new tailings storage facility, $15 million for Fekola underground development, $4 million for solar plant expansion and $2 million for power generation.As a result of the delay in accessing higher-grade ounces from Phase 7 of the Fekola pit, the Fekola Mine is now expected to produce between 420,000 and 450,000 ounces of gold in 2024 (original guidance of between 470,000 and 500,000 ounces) at cash operating costs of between $870 and $930 per ounce (original guidance of between $835 and $895 per ounce) and all-in sustaining costs of between $1,510 and $1,570 per ounce (original guidance of between $1,420 and $1,480 per ounce).Fekola Regional DevelopmentThe Fekola Complex is comprised of the Fekola Mine (Medinandi permit hosting the Fekola and Cardinal pits and Fekola underground) and Fekola Regional (Anaconda Area (Bantako, Menankoto, and Bakolobi permits) and the Dandoko permit).The development of Fekola Regional is expected to demonstrate positive economics through the enhancement of the overall production profile and the extension of mine life of the Fekola Complex. Based on B2Gold's preliminary planning, Fekola Regional could provide selective higher-grade saprolite material (average annual grade of up to 2.2 g/t gold) to be trucked approximately 20 km and fed into the Fekola mill at a rate of up to 1.5 million tonnes per annum (“Mtpa”). Trucking of selective higher grade saprolite material from the Anaconda Area to the Fekola mill will increase the ore processed and has the potential to generate approximately 80,000 to 100,000 ounces of additional gold production per year from Fekola Regional sources.Receipt of a mining permit for the Fekola Regional licenses remains outstanding. The Company expects to apply for such a permit in the third quarter of 2024 following the finalization of the implementation decree for the new 2023 Mining Code by the State of Mali in July 2024. Throughout the first half of 2024, B2Gold has continued to hold meetings with the representatives of the Government of Mali regarding the 2023 Mining Code and the parties are close to finalizing an agreement that will cover the future operation of the Fekola Complex. The Government of Mali has expressed their desire for B2Gold to rapidly progress the development of Fekola Regional and committed to assisting the Company in such development. Importantly, the haul road from Fekola Regional to the Fekola Mine is operational as construction of the haul roads and mining infrastructure (warehouse, workshop, fuel depot and offices) was completed on schedule in 2023.The known and estimated changes to the financial framework of the Fekola Complex as impacted by the 2023 Mining Code and the ongoing discussions with the State of Mali as to its application are considered to be updated indicators of impairment for the Fekola Complex assets. The Company’s analysis concluded that the Fekola Complex was impaired resulting in a non-cash net impairment charge of $194 million in Q2 2024 and a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the Fekola Complex assets at the balance sheet date. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the Fekola Complex’s mining interests was $985 million. Significant exploration potential remains across the Fekola Complex to further extend the mine life. It is anticipated that exploration drilling will recommence in Mali in the second half of 2024.Masbate Mine – The Philippines Three months endedSix months ended June 30,June 30, 2024202320242023     Gold revenue ($ in thousands)109,083111,291208,050168,283Gold sold (ounces)46,60056,70094,30086,350Average realized gold price ($/ ounce)2,3411,9632,2061,949Tonnes of ore milled2,043,0572,000,3604,212,5194,069,402Grade (grams/ tonne)0.941.030.960.99Recovery (%)72.474.372.473.9Gold production (ounces)44,51549,47894,29795,842Production costs ($ in thousands)37,60248,17080,37373,163Cash operating costs(1) ($/ gold ounce sold)807850852847Cash operating costs(1) ($/ gold ounce produced)876817854849Total cash costs(1) ($/ gold ounce sold)955960983971All-in sustaining costs(1) ($/ gold ounce sold)1,1351,0911,1771,169Capital expenditures ($ in thousands)6,5076,09815,03715,051Exploration ($ in thousands)9281,0081,7491,967(1) Non-IFRS measure. For a description of how these measures are calculated and a reconciliation of these measures to the most directly comparable measures specified, defined or determined under IFRS and presented in the Company’s financial statements, refer to “Non-IFRS Measures”.The Masbate Mine in the Philippines continued its strong performance with second quarter of 2024 gold production of 44,515 ounces, slightly above expectations. For the second quarter of 2024, mill feed grade was 0.94 g/t, mill throughput was 2.04 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 72.4%, lower than expected. Lower gold recovery was a result of mining additional lower recovery high-grade sulphide ore during the second quarter of 2024. Actual gold recovery for the second quarter of 2024 remained in line with modeled recovery values for the ore mined.The Masbate Mine's cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $876 per gold ounce produced ($807 per gold ounce sold). Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the second quarter of 2024 were lower than expected as a result of higher gold production and lower than anticipated mining and processing costs due to higher productivity and lower diesel and heavy fuel oil costs.All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,135 per ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the second quarter of 2024 were lower than expected as a result of lower than anticipated production costs per gold ounce sold.Capital expenditures in the second quarter of 2024 totalled $7 million, primarily consisting of $2 million for mobile equipment purchases and rebuilds, $2 million for process plant maintenance, $1 million for expansion of the existing tailings storage facility and $1 million for deferred stripping.The Masbate Mine is now expected to produce between 175,000 and 195,000 ounces of gold in 2024 (original guidance of between 170,000 and 190,000 ounces) at cash operating costs of between $910 and $970 per ounce (original guidance of between $945 and $1,005 per ounce) and all-in sustaining costs of between $1,260 and $1,320 per ounce (original guidance of between $1,300 and $1,360 per ounce). Gold production is scheduled to be relatively consistent throughout 2024. For 2024, Masbate is expected to process 7.9 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 0.93 g/t with a process gold recovery of 76.0%. Mill feed will be a blend of mined fresh ore and low-grade ore stockpiles.Otjikoto Mine - Namibia Three months endedSix months ended June 30,June 30, 2024202320242023     Gold revenue ($ in thousands)112,89477,891219,053180,230Gold sold (ounces)48,34039,55099,79094,000Average realized gold price ($/ ounce)2,3351,9692,1951,917Tonnes of ore milled850,649875,0551,677,1261,699,007Grade (grams/ tonne)1.791.591.761.53Recovery (%)98.698.798.598.7Gold production (ounces)48,14344,05693,55982,547Production costs ($ in thousands)32,21625,34761,08550,297Cash operating costs(1) ($/ gold ounce sold)666641612535Cash operating costs(1) ($/ gold ounce produced)673611658609Total cash costs(1) ($/ gold ounce sold)760720700612All-in sustaining costs(1) ($/ gold ounce sold)1,0441,1871,0001,024Capital expenditures ($ in thousands)11,70615,63025,51932,976Exploration ($ in thousands)1,5149963,3031,490(1) Non-IFRS measure.

For the second quarter of 2024, mill feed grade was 1.79 g/t, mill throughput was 0.85 million tonnes, and gold recovery averaged 98.6%.Ore production from the Wolfshag underground mine for the second quarter of 2024 averaged over 1,500 tonnes per day at an average grade of 4.69 g/t gold. As of the beginning of 2024, the Probable Mineral Reserve estimate for the Wolfshag deposit included 100,000 ounces of gold in 0.6 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 5.02 g/t gold. Open pit mining operations at the Otjikoto Mine will continue to ramp down in 2024 and conclude in 2025, while processing operations are expected to continue until economically viable stockpiles are exhausted in 2031. Underground operations are currently projected to continue until 2026 with potential to extend underground operations if the ongoing underground exploration program is successful in identifying more underground mineral deposits.On January 31, 2024, the Company announced positive exploration drilling results from the Antelope deposit at the Otjikoto Mine. The Antelope deposit, which comprises the Springbok Zone, the Oryx Zone, and a possible third structure, Impala, subject to further confirmatory drilling, is located approximately three km south of the Otjikoto open pit. On June 20, 2024, the Company announced an initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate for the Springbok Zone, the southernmost shoot of the recently discovered Antelope deposit. Over 36,000 meters have been drilled into the Springbok Zone to date, with 33 holes totaling 16,950 meters completed in 2024, to establish the 50 x 50 meter spacing that informs this initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate. Recent drilling at the Springbok Zone remains open southward, indicating additional exploration potential beyond the currently defined resource. The Company determined that the initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate of 1.75 million tonnes grading 6.91 g/t gold for a total of 390,000 ounces of gold was sufficient to initiate a PEA on development of the deposit by underground mining methods, similar to the Wolfshag deposit. Subject to receipt of a positive PEA and permit, mining of the Springbok Zone, coupled with the exploration potential of the greater Antelope deposit, could begin to contribute to gold production at Otjikoto in 2026. The Antelope deposit has the potential to be developed as an underground mining operation, which could complement the expected processing of low-grade stockpiles at the Otjikoto mill from 2026 to 2031. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability. There is no guarantee that all or any part of the Mineral Resource will be converted into a Mineral Reserve. Inferred Mineral Resources are considered too geologically speculative to have mining and economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves.The Otjikoto Mine's cash operating costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $673 per gold ounce produced ($666 per ounce gold sold). Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced for the second quarter of 2024 were higher than anticipated due to lower than expected credits for deferred stripping resulting from more ore being mined than anticipated and lower capitalized underground development credits for the second quarter of 2024.All-in sustaining costs (see “Non-IFRS Measures”) for the second quarter of 2024 were $1,044 per gold ounce sold. All-in sustaining costs for the second quarter of 2024 were slightly higher than expected as a result of higher than expected cash operating costs and higher gold royalties due to a higher than anticipated average realized gold price, partially offset by lower than expected sustaining capital expenditures and higher than anticipated gold ounces sold.Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2024 totalled $12 million, consisting of $9 million for deferred stripping in the Otjikoto pit, $2 million for Wolfshag underground mine development and $1 million for mining equipment rebuilds.The Otjikoto Mine is now expected to produce between 185,000 and 205,000 ounces of gold in 2024 (original guidance of between 180,000 and 200,000 ounces) at cash operating costs in the upper end of its guidance range of between $685 and $745 per ounce and all-in sustaining costs of between $960 and $1,020 per ounce. Gold production at Otjikoto is expected to be relatively consistent throughout 2024. For 2024, Otjikoto is expected to process a total of 3.4 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 1.77 g/t gold with a process gold recovery of 98.0%. Processed ore will be sourced from the Otjikoto pit and the Wolfshag underground mine, supplemented by existing medium and high-grade ore stockpiles.Goose Project Development The Back River Gold District consists of five mineral claims blocks along an 80 km belt. Construction is underway at the most advanced project in the district, the Goose Project, and has been de-risked with significant infrastructure currently in place.B2Gold recognizes that respect and collaboration with the Kitikmeot Inuit Association (“KIA”) is central to the license to operate in the Back River Gold District and will continue to prioritize developing the project in a manner that recognizes Inuit priorities, addresses concerns, and brings long-term socio-economic benefits to the Kitikmeot Region. B2Gold looks forward to continuing to build on its strong collaboration with the KIA and Kitikmeot Communities.As announced in May 2024, development of the open pit and underground was slightly behind schedule due to equipment availability (commissioning and availability of the open pit equipment), adverse weather conditions and the prioritization of critical path construction activities. An additional three months of mining was added to the schedule to ensure that the Umwelt open pit, underground development and crown pillar activities align and that there is significant tailings storage capacity in the Echo open pit. With the schedule change, the mill is expected to start wet commissioning in the second quarter of 2025 with ramp up to full production in the third quarter of 2025. This does not impact the other facets of the project and staffing tables have been adjusted to ensure that capital is conserved. The Company continues to estimate that gold production in calendar year 2025 will be between 120,000 ounces and 150,000 ounces (previously estimated to be between 220,000 ounces and 260,000 ounces). Importantly, the updated mining schedule does not impact the total number of gold ounces the Company expects to produce over the life of mine of the Goose Project. The updated production profile has resulted in the Company estimating that average annual gold production from 2026 to 2030 will increase to be in excess of 310,000 ounces per year (previously estimated at 300,000 ounces per year).B2Gold successfully completed the 2024 WIR campaign in the second quarter of 2024 and has delivered all necessary materials from the MLA to complete the construction of the Goose Project. All planned construction for the first half of 2024 that is necessary to produce gold by the end of the second quarter of 2025 has been completed and project development remains on schedule. The key construction items that were completed in the second quarter included the installation of Phase 2 of the Goose Project accommodation complex, which expanded camp capacity to more than 600 beds; the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the MLA to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, which are anticipated to begin to receive fuel in August 2024; the construction of three additional fuel storage tanks at the Goose Project site to increase fuel storage capacity to more than 80 million liters of fuel, of which two of the three tanks have been completed with the third tank expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2024; the purchase of materials necessary to complete construction and the staging of those materials for shipment to the MLA, with ten ships and one barge having been scheduled (seven ships with dry cargo of more than 120,000m3 and three ships with more than 80 million liters of fuel) and prepared to depart for the MLA during the 2024 sealift in August and September; the purchase of additional trucks for the 2025 WIR campaign, with a total of 105 trucks now available; the placement of more than 75% of the concrete, with more than 90% of the concrete expected to be placed by the end of the third quarter of 2024; the placement of all E-houses on the mill pad with electricians now working on connecting power to various components; piping work focused on the fuel storage tanks and the final Heavy Mechanical Equipment workshop; and the development of access for placement of piping and barge for fresh water system, with installation expected in the third quarter of 2024.Development of the open pit and underground remain on the critical path to ensure that adequate material is available for start up and that the Echo pit is available for tailings placement. The open pit started slowly, but showed good progress in the second quarter of 2024, meeting production targets, and is anticipated to be ready to receive tailings when the mill starts. The underground mine remains on schedule for commencement of production by the end of the second quarter of 2025. B2Gold is currently reviewing final options for mining of the crown pillar and maximizing volumes of the Echo pit.After completing a detailed design review of the Goose Project, B2Gold announced in January 2024 a revised construction capital estimate to C$1,050 million. In addition, before wet commissioning the Company estimated it will spend an additional C$200 million on underground development, deferred stripping and sustaining capital, as well as an additional C$205 million for fuels, reagents, and other working capital items necessary to build up site inventory levels due to the seasonality of the project logistics. In the second quarter of 2024, the Company incurred cash expenditures of $128 million (C$175 million) for the Goose Project on construction and mine development activities and $43 million (C$58 million) on supplies inventory. After successful completion of the 2024 WIR, it is anticipated that cash expenditures on construction and mine development activities will be lower in the second half of 2024 compared to the cash expenditures incurred in the first half of 2024.B2Gold is currently updating the total construction capital estimate to incorporate the (previously announced) three month delay in commencement of operations and additional costs associated with logistics of shipping materials to the Goose Project site via air transport. A final updated budget is expected to be released in early September 2024.Gramalote Project DevelopmentOn June 18, 2024, the Company announced positive PEA results on its 100% owned Gramalote Project located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia. Based on the preliminary results completed in 2022, the contemplated larger-scale project with AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. did not meet the combined investment return thresholds for development. In 2023, B2Gold completed a detailed review of the Gramalote Project with the goal of identifying a higher-return project than the previously contemplated joint venture development plan. The results of the review allowed the Company to determine the optimal parameters and assumptions for the PEA.The PEA, with an effective date of April 1, 2024, was prepared by B2Gold and evaluates recovery of gold from an open pit mining operation that will move up to approximately 97,000 tonnes per day (“tpd”) (35.3 Mtpa) with an approximately 16,500 tpd (6.0 Mtpa) processing plant that includes crushing, grinding, flotation, with fine grinding of the flotation concentrate and agitated leaching of the flotation concentrate followed by a carbon-in-pulp recovery process to process doré bullion. The Mineral Resource estimate for the Gramalote Project that formed the basis for the PEA includes Indicated Mineral Resources of 192.2 million tonnes grading 0.68 g/t gold for a total of 4,210,000 ounces of gold and Inferred Mineral Resources of 85.4 million tonnes grading 0.54 g/t gold for a total of 1,480,000 ounces of gold.The PEA outlines a significant production profile with average annual gold production of 185,000 ounces over a 12.5 year project life with a low-cost structure and favorable metallurgical characteristics. Additionally, the PEA outlines strong project economics with an after-tax NPV5% of $778 million and an after-tax IRR of 20.6%, with a project payback on pre-production capital of 3.1 years, and an estimated pre-production capital cost for the project of $807 million (including approximately $93 million for mining equipment and $63 million for contingency). A robust amount of historical drilling and engineering studies have been completed on the Gramalote Project, which significantly de-risks future project development. Based on the positive results from the PEA, B2Gold believes that the Gramalote Project has the potential to become a medium-scale, low-cost open pit gold mine.The PEA is preliminary in nature and includes a small amount of Inferred Mineral Resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have the economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as Mineral Reserves, and there is no certainty that the PEA based on these Mineral Resources will be realized. Mineral Resources that are not Mineral Reserves do not have demonstrated economic viability.B2Gold has commenced feasibility work with the goal of completing a feasibility study by mid-2025 and a $10 million budget has been approved by the Board. Due to the work completed for previous studies, the work remaining to finalize a feasibility study for the updated medium-scale project is not extensive. The main work programs for the feasibility study include geotechnical and environmental site investigations for the processing plant and waste dump footprints, as well as capital and operating cost estimates.The Gramalote Project will continue to advance resettlement programs, establish coexistence programs for small miners, work on health, safety and environmental projects and continue to work with the government and local communities on social programs.Due to the desired modifications to the processing plant and infrastructure locations, a Modified Environment Impact Study is required. B2Gold has commenced work on the modifications to the Environment Impact Study and expect it to be completed and submitted shortly following the completion of the feasibility study. If the final economics of the feasibility study are positive and B2Gold makes the decision to develop the Gramalote Project as an open pit gold mine, B2Gold would utilize its proven internal mine construction team to build the mine and mill facilities.OutlookTotal gold production for 2024 is forecast to be between 800,000 and 870,000 ounces, including 20,000 ounces of attributable gold production from Calibre.Based on current estimates, consolidated gold production in 2025 is expected to materially improve, driven by a significant increase in gold production from the Fekola Complex, relative to 2024, as a result of the scheduled mining and processing of higher-grade ore from the Fekola and Cardinal pits made accessible by the meaningful stripping campaign that will be undertaken throughout 2024, the expected full year contribution of higher-grade ore from Fekola Regional which is anticipated to contribute between 80,000 to 100,000 ounces of additional production, and commencement of mining the higher-grade Fekola underground (subject to receipt of necessary permits for Fekola Regional and Fekola underground).Upon completion of construction activities at the Goose Project, the mine is expected to commence gold production in the second quarter of 2025 and contribute between 120,000 and 150,000 ounces of gold production in calendar year 2025. Over the first five full calendar years of operation from 2026 to 2030, the average annual gold production for the Goose Project is estimated to be in excess of 310,000 ounces of gold per year.The positive PEA results on the Company’s 100% owned Gramalote Project, located in the Department of Antioquia, Colombia, outlines a significant production profile with average annual gold production of 234,000 ounces per year for the first five years of production, and strong project economics with an after-tax NPV5% of $778 million and an after-tax IRR of 20.6% over a 12.5 year project life. As a result, B2Gold has commenced feasibility work with the goal of completing a feasibility study by mid-2025 and a $10 million budget has been approved by the Board.Following the release of an initial Inferred Mineral Resource Estimate for the Springbok Zone, the southernmost shoot of the recently discovered Antelope deposit, in the second quarter of 2024, the Company has commenced a PEA which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2025. Subject to receipt of a positive PEA and permit, mining of the Springbok Zone, coupled with the exploration potential of the greater Antelope deposit, could begin to contribute to gold production at Otjikoto in 2026. The Antelope deposit has the potential to supplement the processing of low-grade stockpiles at the Otjikoto Mine through 2031, with the goal of increasing gold production levels to over 100,000 ounces per year from 2026 through 2031.The Company's ongoing strategy is to continue to maximize profitable production from its existing mines, maintain a strong financial position, realize the significant potential increase in gold production from the Company’s existing development projects, continue exploration programs across the Company’s robust land packages, evaluate new exploration, development and production opportunities, and continue to return capital to shareholders.Second Quarter 2024 Financial Results - Conference Call DetailsB2Gold executives will host a conference call to discuss the results on Friday, August 9, 2024, at 8:00 am PT / 11:00 am ET.Participants may register for the conference call here: registration link.

MEASURESCash operating costs per gold ounce sold and total cash costs per gold ounce sold‘‘Cash operating costs per gold ounce’’ and “total cash costs per gold ounce” are common financial performance measures in the gold mining industry but, as non-IFRS measures, they do not have a standardized meaning under IFRS and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate our performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, these measures are intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. The measures, along with sales, are considered to be a key indicator of the Company’s ability to generate earnings and cash flow from its mining operations.Cash cost figures are calculated on a sales basis in accordance with a standard developed by The Gold Institute, which was a worldwide association of suppliers of gold and gold products and included leading North American gold producers. The Gold Institute ceased operations in 2002, but the standard is the accepted standard of reporting cash cost of production in North America. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Other companies may calculate these measures differently. Cash operating costs and total cash costs per gold ounce sold are derived from amounts included in the statement of operations and include mine site operating costs such as mining, processing, smelting, refining, transportation costs, royalties and production taxes, less silver by-product credits. The tables below show a reconciliation of cash operating costs per gold ounce sold and total cash costs per gold ounce sold to production costs as extracted from the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements on a consolidated and a mine-by-mine basis (dollars in thousands): For the three months ended June 30, 2024 Fekola MineMasbate MineOtjikoto MineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrand Total $$$$$$       Production costs81,48137,60232,216151,29913,221164,520Royalties and production taxes21,6556,9104,52433,08971133,800       Total cash costs103,13644,51236,740184,38813,932198,320       Gold sold (ounces)115,28846,60048,340210,2288,267218,495       Cash operating costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)7078076667201,599753       Total cash costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)8959557608771,685908 For the three months ended June 30, 2023 Fekola MineMasbate MineOtjikoto MineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrand Total $$$$$$       Production costs79,24548,17025,347152,76217,815170,577Royalties and production taxes23,6866,2853,14033,1111,07834,189       Total cash costs102,93154,45528,487185,87318,893204,766       Gold sold (ounces)142,85056,70039,550239,10016,797255,897       Cash operating costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)5558506416391,061667       Total cash costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)7219607207771,125800 For the six months ended June 30, 2024 Fekola MineMasbate MineOtjikoto MineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrand Total $$$$$$       Production costs166,58680,37361,085308,04425,126333,170Royalties and production taxes42,05012,3008,76663,1161,56564,681       Total cash costs208,63692,67369,851371,16026,691397,851       Gold sold (ounces)239,11694,30099,790433,20619,644452,850       Cash operating costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)6978526127111,279736       Total cash costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)8739837008571,359879 For the six months ended June 30, 2023 Fekola MineMasbate MineOtjikoto MineTotalCalibre equity investmentGrand Total $$$$$$       Production costs156,90673,16350,297280,36633,580313,946Royalties and production taxes50,35210,6987,22268,2722,33270,604       Total cash costs207,25883,86157,519348,63835,912384,550       Gold sold (ounces)307,90086,35094,000488,25032,939521,189       Cash operating costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)5108475355741,019602       Total cash costs per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)6739716127141,090738       Cash operating costs per gold ounce produced In addition to cash operating costs on a per gold ounce sold basis, the Company also presents cash operating costs on a per gold ounce produced basis.

The original World Gold Council standard became effective January 1, 2014 with further updates announced on November 16, 2018 which were effective starting January 1, 2019.Management believes that the all-in sustaining costs per gold ounce measure provides additional insight into the costs of producing gold by capturing all of the expenditures required for the discovery, development and sustaining of gold production and allows the Company to assess its ability to support capital expenditures to sustain future production from the generation of operating cash flows. Management believes that, in addition to conventional measures prepared in accordance with IFRS, certain investors use this information to evaluate the Company's performance and ability to generate cash flow. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Adoption of the standard is voluntary and the cost measures presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. The Company has applied the principles of the World Gold Council recommendations and has reported all-in sustaining costs on a sales basis. Other companies may calculate these measures differently.B2Gold defines all-in sustaining costs per ounce as the sum of cash operating costs, royalties and production taxes, capital expenditures and exploration costs that are sustaining in nature, sustaining lease expenditures, corporate general and administrative costs, share-based payment expenses related to restricted share units/deferred share units/performance share units/restricted phantom units ("RSUs/DSUs/PSUs/RPUs"), community relations expenditures, reclamation liability accretion and realized (gains) losses on fuel derivative contracts, all divided by the total gold ounces sold to arrive at a per ounce figure.The table below shows a reconciliation of all-in sustaining costs per ounce to production costs as extracted from the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements on a consolidated and a mine-by-mine basis for the three months ended June 30, 2024 (dollars in thousands): For the three months ended June 30, 2024 Fekola Mine Masbate Mine Otjikoto Mine CorporateTotal Calibre equity investmentGrand Total  $ $ $ $$ $$         Production costs81,481 37,602 32,216 —151,299 13,221164,520 Royalties and production taxes21,655 6,910 4,524 —33,089 71133,800 Corporate administration2,548 548 1,406 8,46612,968 90213,870 Share-based payments – RSUs/DSUs/PSUs/RPUs(1)34 — — 4,0234,057 —4,057 Community relations106 17 319 —442 —442 Reclamation liability accretion458 313 252 —1,023 —1,023 Realized gains on derivative contracts(202)(108)— —(310)—(310)Sustaining lease expenditures83 309 236 5121,140 —1,140 Sustaining capital expenditures(2)38,065 6,428 11,605 —56,098 63756,735 Sustaining mine exploration(2)838 864 (76)—1,626 —1,626         Total all-in sustaining costs145,066 52,883 50,482 13,001261,432 15,471276,903         Gold sold (ounces)115,288 46,600 48,340 —210,228 8,267218,495         All-in sustaining cost per ounce ($/ gold ounce sold)1,258 1,135 1,044 —1,244 1,8711,267 1) Included as a component of Share-based payments on the Statement of operations.

The Company defines adjusted net income as net income attributable to shareholders of the Company adjusted for non-recurring items and also significant recurring non-cash items. The Company defines adjusted earnings per share – basic as adjusted net income divided by the basic weighted number of common shares outstanding.Management believes that the presentation of adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share - basic is appropriate to provide additional information to investors regarding items that we do not expect to continue at the same level in the future or that management does not believe to be a reflection of the Company's ongoing operating performance. Management further believes that its presentation of these non-IFRS financial measures provide information that is useful to investors because they are important indicators of the strength of our operations and the performance of our core business. Accordingly, it is intended to provide additional information and should not be considered in isolation as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with IFRS. Other companies may calculate this measure differently.A reconciliation of net income to adjusted net income as extracted from the unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements is set out in the table below: Three months endedSix months ended June 30,June 30, 2024202320242023 $$$$ (000’s)(000’s)(000’s)(000’s)     Net (loss) income attributable to shareholders of the Company for the period:(24,004)80,418 15,747 166,391      Adjustments for non-recurring and significant recurring non-cash items:    Impairment of long-lived assets197,141 4,885 197,141 4,885 Write-down of mining interests636 — 636 16,419 Gain on sale of shares in associate(16,822)— (16,822)— Gain on sale of mining interests(48,662)— (48,662)— Unrealized (gains) losses on derivative instruments(119)757 (1)3,545 Office lease termination costs— — — 1,946 Loan receivable provision— 2,085 — 2,085 Change in fair value of gold stream8,387 1,100 19,239 1,100 (Gain) loss on dilution of associate(998)— 8,984 — Deferred income tax recovery(37,110)(3,441)(16,310)(4,705)     Adjusted net income attributable to shareholders of the Company for the period78,449 85,804 159,952 191,666      Basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding (in thousands)1,307,176 1,251,832 1,305,183 1,164,104      Adjusted net earnings attributable to shareholders of the Company per share–basic ($/share)0.06 0.07 0.12 0.16
