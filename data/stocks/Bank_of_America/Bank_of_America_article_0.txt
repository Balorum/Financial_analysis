On Tuesday, CFRA downgraded shares of Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) from Hold to Sell, while slightly increasing the price target to $39 from $38. The firm's revised target is based on an 11.5x forward P/E of their 2025 earnings estimate, which aligns with the company's three-year historical average and is above the peer average of 10.3x.The downgrade comes after Bank of America reported a second consecutive quarter of stagnant deposit and loan growth, and a 3% decline in net interest income (NII) in the second quarter of 2024.
