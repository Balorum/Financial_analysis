Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRKb) (NYSE:BRKa) has been aggressively buying shares of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) over the past nine trading sessions, increasing its stake to nearly 29%. This significant buying spree follows Berkshire's acquisition of a new position in Chubb (NYSE:CB) Ltd. last month.This recent purchase brings Berkshire Hathaway's ownership to nearly 29% of Occidental Petroleum. The company revealed in a filing that it made three separate purchases of Occidental shares between June 13th and 17th, averaging just under $60 per share, with a total investment of approximately $176 million.Buffett's confidence in Occidental is further underscored by his existing warrants to buy an additional 83.5 million shares at a discounted price of $59.62 per share, well below the current market price of $61.26 (as of Wednesday's closing).The news of Buffett's increased stake sent Occidental's share price up by 1.76% on Tuesday, following a US market closure on Monday due to a bank holiday. This rise could be the beginning of a sustained upward trend for Occidental.It's worth noting that Occidental's share price had fallen 15.4% from its April 11th peak of $71.18 by Monday's close, before news of Buffett's additional purchase became public.However, the stock showed signs of stabilization in early June, finding support just below $60. This stability likely influenced Buffett's decision to increase his stake, suggesting he believes the stock has reached an attractive buying point.As it turns out, valuation models consider Occidental Petroleum to be slightly undervalued at its current price. Indeed, the InvestingPro Fair Value, which synthesizes several recognized financial models, stands at $66.32, or 8.26% above the current price.Source: InvestingProAnalysts are more optimistic, with an average target of $71.96, which translates into a potential upside of 17.5%. However, the very fact that Buffett owns the stock gives it an aura and premium that could carry it higher than we think.Indeed, tens of thousands of Buffett fans scrupulously imitate the legendary investor's positions.
