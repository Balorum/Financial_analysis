On Thursday, Barclays reiterated its Overweight rating on Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), maintaining a price target of $1,000.00. The firm anticipates an in-line revenue report for the June quarter and projects better-than-expected revenue guidance for the September quarter. This optimism is attributed to the deployment of liquid cooling technologies in some of the largest Direct Liquid Cooling (DLC) AI clouds.The firm does not foresee a positive preannouncement but suggests that Super Micro Computer could surpass its conservative gross margin (GM) guidance for the June quarter, potentially resulting in earnings per share (EPS) that exceed current expectations.Barclays' positive outlook on Super Micro Computer is supported by the anticipated robust year for AI server deployment. This growth is expected to be driven by Tier 2 Cloud providers, high-end enterprises including Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), and various xAI and sovereign AI projects. The firm views Super Micro Computer's competitive position as strong, especially as the industry transitions into the Blackwell era, a period marked by the company's leading role in liquid cooling technology, which offers higher average selling prices (ASPs) and improving margin profiles compared to Hopper-based air-cooled servers.The firm also notes that Super Micro Computer's allocation of shares for the GB200 should foster further growth in the second half of fiscal year 2025 and beyond. This perspective reflects confidence in the company's sustained performance and market position in the foreseeable future.In other recent news, Super Micro Computer and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) have been making waves in the artificial intelligence (AI) sector.
