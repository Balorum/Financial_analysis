With the 2024 US presidential elections approaching on November 5, the political landscape is heating up. The results may take several days to confirm, particularly if the vote margins are narrow. Congress will certify the results on January 6, 2025, and the president-elect will take office on January 20.Before election day, the Republican convention will be held from July 15-18, followed by the Democratic convention from August 19-22. The presidential debates are set for September 16 in San Marcos, Texas, October 1 in Petersburg, Virginia, and October 9 in Salt Lake City, Utah. The vice presidential debate is scheduled for September 25 in Easton, Pennsylvania.The recent debate has dimmed Biden's chances of victory, leading to speculation that the Democrats might consider another candidate. Meanwhile, Trump appears to have an edge for now.Historically, the S&P 500 index's performance three months before the election has been an indicator of the outcome. An increase generally favors the incumbent, while a decrease benefits the challenger, a pattern that has held true 87% of the time since 1920. Similarly, the dollar's strength can offer clues: a strong dollar typically favors the incumbent party, while a weak dollar benefits the opposition.A Trump victory could bolster the US dollar due to his protectionist stance, including a proposed 10% tariff on imports. However, retaliatory tariffs from other countries could mitigate this effect.So considering the above, here's how stocks could react in both scenarios:Trump has promised to cut corporate taxes by lowering them from 21% to 20% while making the 2017 Republican tax law permanent.
