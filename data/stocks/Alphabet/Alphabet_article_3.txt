There are plenty of things for an executive to worry about, but Jeff Green probably has one of the best gigs in town."I'm way more concerned about the tidal wave of opportunity being too big and us not being equipped to handle all of the opportunity that comes to us than I am that the wave doesn't exist or it's too small," Green, the CEO, and co-founder of The Trade Desk  (TTD) , said during the company's recent earnings call.Related: Analyst revises Trade Desk stock price target ahead of earningsGreen's enthusiasm was undoubtedly related to the company's second-quarter results, which beat Wall Street's expectations."Our growth rate significantly outpaced the rest of the digital marketing industry just as it has every quarter for the last few years," he told analysts.The Trade Desk, a programmatic marketing company, enables buying media inventory across various channels, including display, video, audio, and connected TV, most commonly used to stream video.Green noted that the total addressable global digital advertising market has the potential to reach $1 trillion and added that the Trade Desk is positioned well to capture more than its fair share of that $1 trillion.Greg Doherty/Getty Images"I'm convinced that our success has been forged on the back of consistent strong 20%-plus revenue growth year after year for the past several years," he told analysts. "By comparison, our ad-funded peers have gone through periods of much lower growth and even stagnation in some cases.""That means we are consistently gaining market share quarter after quarter and year after year," Green added. "And I firmly believe that's because we continue to bring the best innovation and best value to the market."Related: Analyst reboots Trade Desk stock price target after Netflix dealHe also discussed Kokai, the AI-based media buying platform that the company launched last year."Kokai allows our clients to deploy data about their most loyal customers and then use that data as a seed to grow and harvest the next generation of loyal customers," he said. "Kokai helps them target those new audiences across the many thousands of destinations that comprise the best of the open Internet.""And it leverages AI to help them make sense of the roughly 15 million ad opportunities we see every second and the hundreds of variables associated with each one of them," Green added. Green discussed Alphabet's  (GOOGL)  current legal headaches during the question and answer period.Judge Amit Mehta of the US District Court of the District of Columbia decided on Aug. 5 that Alphabet, Inc.’s Google illegally monopolized the search engine market through exclusive deals with Apple,  (AAPL) , and others.Related: Analysts review Apple stock price hit from Google antitrust rulingGoogle is also facing an antitrust trial next month in the Eastern District of Virginia over anticompetitive conduct in advertising technology, which Bloomberg Law said "could be a seismic event—potentially determining whether Google remains a single entity or is fragmented into separate companies.""They are a weaker competitor than they've been for us in years past," Green said. "And as I've often said, we've been winning in an unfair market. Imagine what we could do if we're competing in a fair market.""I think as a result of that, I believe we'll win no matter what the outcomes of this case are, but it will still be fun to watch," he noted.The Trade Desk posted second-quarter earnings of 39 cents per share, up from 28 cents a year ago and beating the consensus estimate of 36 cents per share.Revenue totaled $584.6 million, up from $464 million a year ago, and coming in ahead of Wall Street’s call for $578.1 million in sales.Looking ahead, the company guided to third-quarter revenue of $618 million, above estimates of $605.5 million.More Tech Stocks:Sony’s Bungie criticized for layoffs after CEO spends millionsNvidia stock tumbles in tech slump amid questions over key chipAnalysts adjust Palantir stock price target ahead of earningsTheStreet Pro’s Chris Versace liked those numbers and raised his price target on The Trade Desk shares to $120 from $110."Trade Desk continues to benefit from the overall mix shift toward digital advertising as advertisers look to reach consumer eyeballs," he wrote in his Aug. 9 column."It is also benefiting from the growing use of advertising business models across streaming video platforms and digital audio like those found at Netflix  (NFLX) , Disney  (DIS) , Warner Bros.
