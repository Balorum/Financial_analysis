On today's episode of Catalysts, Hosts Seana Smith and Madison Mills break down some of the trading day's biggest stories, from the global market sell-off to some of the latest earnings reports.The major indexes (^DJI,^GSPC, ^IXIC) are bouncing back after a three-day sell-off triggered by a weaker-than-expected jobs report in July. As investors continue to be wary of a recession, Apollo Global Management chief economist Torsten Slok notes that despite the weak labor report, there's not much other evidence that points to a recession: "Daily data for how many people fly on airplanes as of last Friday is still strong. Daily data from OpenTable for how many people go to restaurants is still strong. Weekly data for retail sales from Redbook is also still strong. Hotel occupancy rates, the weekly data also still strong."He reiterates Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's emphasis on the totality of the data, and adds, "the market is overreacting to just one data point." Note: Apollo Global Management is Yahoo's parent company.Longview Economics founder, CEO, and chief market strategist Chris Watling explains, "Sell-offs tend to happen in waves. So it's not just a straight line down, then we're done. You know, they tend to be three waves or five waves. And in the middle of that, you get these relief rallies. So it's perfectly natural that you have a very aggressive downside, a little bit of short covering, which creates a rally, which is probably what we're in now." For investors trying to navigate the pullback, he encourages them to "buy the bounce, trade them for a couple of weeks, go long if you're nimble, but really lighten up if you're if you're sort of multi-month investor. It all depends on your time frames. That's the challenge."A federal judge found Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) Google search and advertising business to be in violation of antitrust laws. Presiding over the case levied by the Department of Justice, US District Judge Amit P. Mehta wrote "Google is a monopolist, and it has acted as one to maintain its monopoly." Many experts are speculating whether this ruling over Google's search dominance could impact another tech giant: Apple (AAPL). Yahoo Finance tech editor Dan Howley explains why this antitrust case could hurt the iPhone maker who has a revenue-sharing agreement with Google to make its search engine the default on its smartphones.Meanwhile, new earnings reports hit the market on Tuesday. Shares of Saudi Aramco (2223.SR) are trading higher after the company met second quarter net income expectations and will pay a quarterly dividend totaling $31.1 billion.Shares of Yum! Brands (YUM) are also climbing despite reporting mixed second quarter results. While the KFC and Taco Bell parent missed revenue expectations and saw same-store sales drop in those chains, its earnings topped analyst forecasts. Yum! Brands attributed the weakness to a softening consumer spending environment and Middle East tensions.This post was written by Melanie Riehl
