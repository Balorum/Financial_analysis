We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Consumer Discretionary Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other consumer discretionary stocks.Many experts and analysts are concerned about a slowdown in consumer spending. However, reports show that consumer behavior is changing rather than slowing down. According to a report by Colliers Retail Market Intelligence, retail foot traffic rose by 4.4% in June, indicating strong consumer activity despite flat overall sales.While furniture and home improvement stores saw declines due to reduced monumental purchases and a sluggish housing market, grocery stores, and apparel retailers performed better. Grocery sales grew by 1.7%, with a nearly 5% increase in foot traffic, as consumers managed their budgets despite cutting costs. Apparel sales also increased by 3.8%, driven by early back-to-school shopping and wardrobe updates, leading to an 8.3% rise in foot traffic.In July, consumer spending saw a modest increase compared to June, with gains across 10 of 12 retail categories, as reported by the CNBC/National Retail Federation (NRF) Retail Monitor. Retail sales, excluding autos and gas, rose by 0.7% month-over-month, slightly up from June's 0.5%, but the year-over-year growth slowed to 0.9%, down from 3.4% in June.Core retail, which excludes restaurants, saw a 1% monthly increase. Significant sector performances included a 3.4% rise in gas station sales and a 2.1% increase in restaurant spending month-over-month. Conversely, the healthcare, personal care, and garden supplies sectors experienced slight declines.June and July data together indicate that consumer spending remains resilient, supported by strong household finances and a strong job market. While some sectors, particularly furniture and home improvement, are struggling due to reduced consumer confidence and a slow housing market, other categories are performing well.The data suggests that consumers are still willing to spend, especially on essential and seasonal items, though they may be more cautious with larger purchases. Despite some areas of decline, the overall retail environment appears stable, with consumers continuing to spend where they find value, which indicates a cautiously optimistic outlook for the remainder of 2024.In the July meeting, Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighted the Fed's ongoing focus on achieving maximum employment and stable prices. He noted significant progress in the economy, with inflation dropping from 7% to 2.5% and a balanced labor market with low unemployment at 4.1%. The Fed chose to keep interest rates steady within the 5.25% to 5.5% range and continue to reduce its securities holdings to maintain a restrictive stance, which is aimed at aligning demand with supply and reducing inflationary pressures.Powell mentioned that while inflation has eased, the Fed is not yet ready to lower rates and requires more consistent positive data before making such a move, possibly as early as September. According to the CME Fed Watch Tool, all the experts are expecting cuts in September. 50.5% of the experts predict a 25 basis points (bps) reduction in the interest rates while 49.5% expect a 50 bps cut.Rate cuts generally have a positive effect on consumer spending. When interest rates are lowered, borrowing becomes cheaper, which could lead to increased consumer borrowing and spending. This increased affordability can boost consumer confidence and promote spending on discretionary items.
