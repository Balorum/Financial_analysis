Discovery hasn't been discussed in detail, it is likely that ownership wouldn't be evenly split due to the current nature and finances of the streaming assets.Max, Warner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer business, boasts about 100 million global subscribers, with 52.7 million based in the U.S. Meanwhile, Paramount+ ended its first quarter with 71 million subscribers.NBCUniversal, owned by Comcast Corp (NASDAQ:CMCSA), has also shown interest in a joint venture with Paramount+. However, these discussions did not progress significantly.Since late 2019, traditional media companies including Paramount Global, Disney, NBCUniversal, and Warner Bros. Discovery have all launched streaming services, resulting in billions of dollars in losses. The industry consensus suggests there are too many streaming services relative to the number of total paying customers.If Paramount finalizes a joint venture with either Max or Peacock, it could put pressure on the remaining service to seek a similar deal.Media companies are now focusing on better monetizing streaming content through bundles and partnerships. For example, Disney and Warner Bros. Discovery have recently become more willing to license some of their content to rival streaming services, such as Netflix, to better monetize shows that aren't adding a lot of new subscribers to their streaming services.
