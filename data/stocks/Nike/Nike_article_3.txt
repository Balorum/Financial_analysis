On Friday, CFRA raised its rating on shares of  Nike  (NYSE: NYSE:NKE) shares from Hold to Buy, setting a price target of $89.00. The firm cites emerging value in the apparel and footwear giant's stock, despite a forecasted top-line slowdown and increased competition.Nike's price target is based on a 25.5 times multiple of the firm's projected earnings per share (EPS) for the fiscal year ending in March 2025 (FY 25), which is below the company's two-year average forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 28.8 times.The analyst's assessment reflects a belief that Nike's stock multiple has been inflated in recent years and should align more closely with its pre-pandemic levels in the mid-20s. Nike, known for its strong brand in the footwear and apparel market globally, is expected to navigate through the revenue decline experienced in the first half of the year and still achieve an EPS of $3.50 in FY 25.Nike's recent Q4 earnings call indicated a significant top-line slowdown, and the company is facing new competition from brands like Hoka and On. Still, CFRA sees this as an opportunity for investors, with Nike's shares becoming more attractive as the company focuses on innovation and operational efficiencies. The firm anticipates a low-single-digit revenue decline for Nike over the next 12 months but expects slightly higher margins.The upgrade to Buy reflects confidence in Nike's continued market leadership and its robust financial position. CFRA points to Nike's "fortress balance sheet" and its ability to return significant capital as additional strengths. This financial stability, combined with the company's commitment to innovation and efficiency, underpins the positive outlook for Nike's stock performance.In other recent news, Nike, the sportswear giant, has been the center of several significant developments.
