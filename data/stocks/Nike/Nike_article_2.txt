On Wednesday, Deutsche Bank revised its price target on shares of  Nike  (NYSE: NKE), reducing it to $92 from the previous $115, while still maintaining a Buy rating on the stock. The adjustment comes in light of Nike's fourth-quarter results and a more significant-than-anticipated sales forecast revision for fiscal year 2025. The bank's analyst highlighted that the company's performance indicates a need for more patience as it navigates through current challenges, including a weak market in China and a difficult global economic environment.Despite these challenges, Nike is streamlining its lifestyle franchises within its direct-to-consumer channel, a move that is anticipated to strengthen the business in the medium to long term. Deutsche Bank is optimistic about Nike's strategy to introduce new styles and products starting in fall 2024, accelerating through spring and summer 2025, which is expected to boost sales trends in the second half of fiscal year 2025.The report also notes early indications of success with new products, particularly with performance products experiencing double-digit growth. The bank believes that Nike's advantages in marketing, storytelling, and the ability to manage wholesale partnerships will contribute to improved revenue trends in the latter half of 2025.In light of these strategic initiatives, Deutsche Bank has adjusted its earnings per share (EPS) estimates for Nike for fiscal years 2025 and 2026, reducing them by approximately 23% to $3.13 and $3.55, respectively. Despite the decrease, the firm suggests that these revised estimates are attainable and may even be on the conservative side if Nike's new product introductions gain momentum faster than expected, helping to mitigate the current lifestyle segment challenges.In other recent news, Nike Inc (NYSE:NKE). has announced plans to introduce a new line of budget-friendly sneakers priced at $100 and below, a move designed to attract price-sensitive consumers and compete with rivals such as Adidas (OTC:ADDYY).
